# Packaging & CI

- Exclude non-runtime files from the XPI via `.web-extensionignore`:
```gitignore
deploy.sh
Makefile
distribution.html
REFACTORING_*.md
SOURCE_SUBMISSION.md
web-ext-artifacts/
```
- Run `web-ext lint` in build/CI; fail on warnings about unsafe DOM or packaging.
- Source zip for AMO should include readable sources, license, and `SOURCE_SUBMISSION.md`.
- Reference build scripts: [Makefile](mdc:Makefile)
